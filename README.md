This project was done by Justin Chang and Huy Nguyen for San Jose State University CS255 taught by Professor Katerina Potika. This project contains code that implements lzw compression and decompression. We will compare the compression ratio to the original file and with other products that implements lzw. We will also creat a presentation giving a literature review of other dictionary based loseless compression algorithms.
