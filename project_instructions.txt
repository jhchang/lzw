Dictionary-Based Data Compression Techniques

There are several approaches to data compression. This project concentrates on the dictionary-based approach.

The original dictionary-based data compression methods were the two Lempel-Ziv methods known today as LZ77 and LZ78. The latter was

improved by Welch, resulting in the popular LZW method. Quite a few variants of these methods are known today, the most popular being

LZSS, LZMW, LZAP, LZY and LZP.

The project involves literature search, studying two or three of the above variants, and implementing one of them.
